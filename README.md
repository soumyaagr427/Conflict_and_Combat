## Welcome to the pools of battles!


“conflict and combat” is a mini game project where we derived the basic concept of two character fighting against each other from the very popular and simple Rock-paper-scissors game that is played by two people.

```markdown
In our mini-project, we built a Python function that simulates playing a round of game aka “combat” by generating its own random choice from these alternatives character warriors we provided and then determining the winner using a simple rule that we will next describe
 While a simple Rock-paper-scissor has a set of three rules that logically determine who wins a round of  coding up these rules would require  of if/ elif/ else. We opted for simpler method for determining the winner is to assign each of the respective choices. 
For example: choice number -7
 number:
0 — character 1 
1 — character 2 
2 — character 3 
3 — character 4 
4 — character 5 
5— character 6
6 — character 7
